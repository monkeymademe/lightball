# Lightball

My daughter has this star ball thing... It is supposed to project a star field at the wall. Its just a little fun... Nothing scientific...

Well the inside imploded and we were left with a unit that did not work at all!

So I did what any loving father would do.... I put a Raspberry Pi in it and got it working like it was before.

The ball has 3 buttons A,B,C... 

A and C are push click buttons (meaning it stays pressed when its pressed and when you press it again its released)

B is a standard button.

A = Turn the white LED on/off
B = Cycle through the color modes (including a fade in and out mode)
C = Starts and stops the motor to turn the stars

Code is using GPIOZERO!
